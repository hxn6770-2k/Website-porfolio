                                The artifact I have selected is the To-Do List Application, originally developed for a Mobile Architecture and Programming course. It is an Android app designed to help users manage tasks efficiently, with features like adding, viewing, and clearing tasks. In this enhancement, I focused on integrating a task priority system and improving the task sorting functionality by connecting the app to a database. The database now supports sorting tasks by both priority and deadline, resulting in a more robust and flexible task management system. The enhancements prioritize algorithmic efficiency and database optimization, ensuring that the application can handle growing data while maintaining responsiveness.

                    <!-- ======= Change Description Section ======= -->
                    <h4><strong>How the Artifact Was Improved</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        Several key enhancements were made to the application, focusing on integrating a task priority system, implementing a custom sorting algorithm, and connecting the app to a database. These improvements provide a more robust and flexible task management system.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1. Database Integration for Task Storage:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The application was connected to a SQLite database, updating the task model to include fields for priority and deadline. This enabled efficient CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks, ensuring that the app can manage task data persistently across sessions.</li>
                                <li>By storing both priority and deadline in the database, I improved the app's ability to manage tasks dynamically, ensuring efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. The database queries were optimized to reduce the time complexity of data operations (e.g., retrieval or updates), ensuring minimal latency during task management.</li>
                                <li>Optimization: Efficient use of indexed columns for priority and deadlines minimized retrieval time, ensuring that the sorting of tasks by these fields was not bottlenecked by slow database queries.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><strong>2. Task Sorting by Deadline and Priority:</strong> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>I developed a custom sorting algorithm that orders tasks by priority (High, Medium, Low) and deadline (earliest due first). The algorithm was designed with a time complexity of O(n log n) (using a hybrid of Merge Sort and database indexing), which ensures that sorting remains efficient even as the number of tasks increases.</li>
                                <li>The sorting logic was dynamically linked to the database, so tasks are automatically sorted based on the latest information stored in the database. This tight integration ensures that changes in task data—whether priority or deadline—are reflected immediately in the task display without any noticeable delay.</li>
                                <li>Algorithmic Complexity: Sorting tasks involves using a stable sort to maintain order, and its O(n log n) efficiency ensures scalability as the number of tasks grows.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Here is the updated code for adding a priority field to each task, enabling users to assign <strong>High, Medium, Low</strong> priority. This was implemented through modifications in the task data model.

                                <li>I updated the user interface (UI) to allow users to input both task priority and deadline when creating or editing tasks. This intuitive design ensures that users can interact easily with the new features while maintaining clear task organization.</li>
                                <li>I also improved the task list view to display tasks in the correct order (based on priority and deadline), providing users with a visual representation of which tasks are most critical or time-sensitive. The UI remains responsive due to the efficient algorithmic design of the backend, ensuring smooth sorting even when managing large task lists.</li>

                                The sorting algorithm based on both priority and deadlines showcases my application of algorithmic principles. By using a stable sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n), I ensured that tasks could be organized efficiently without impacting performance. This efficient sorting ensures that users can organize their tasks in a way that optimizes productivity and task visibility. The algorithm was chosen for its scalability and real-time performance.

                                The integration of the Android SDK, Java, and SQLite database systems demonstrates my proficiency in using advanced development tools. I effectively handled data manipulation, storage, and retrieval, while maintaining performance and scalability by ensuring that CRUD operations were optimized for large datasets. The combination of algorithmic logic and database indexing helped maintain low latency, even with growing task lists.

                                By enhancing the database schema and improving CRUD operations, I mitigated risks associated with poor data management. The updated design ensures that tasks are stored reliably and sorted efficiently, which makes the application more robust and user-friendly. By carefully handling database transactions and ensuring proper indexing, I reduced the likelihood of slow queries or data corruption, thus improving the app's resilience to growing user data.

                        This enhancement process was an invaluable learning experience. Integrating the database with the updated task model and sorting logic allowed me to explore new dimensions of backend development. One major insight I gained was the relationship between data structures, algorithms, and user experience—ensuring that database operations were both efficient and aligned with user needs.

                    <p>
                        Updating the database schema to accommodate new fields (task priority and deadline) required careful planning to preserve existing data and ensure that future CRUD operations could be performed efficiently. I optimized the data retrieval process by using indexed columns for priority and deadline, which allowed for faster task sorting and minimal impact on app performance.

                    <p>
                        Through these enhancements, I deepened my understanding of how databases, algorithms, and UI design interact to create a well-rounded, functional application. The improvements I made ensure that the app is not only more efficient in managing tasks but also offers a seamless user experience. This process solidified my ability to design and implement scalable and robust solutions in mobile development, aligning with course outcomes related to software design, data management, and algorithmic problem-solving.
