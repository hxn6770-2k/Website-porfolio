        <h3><strong>Enhancement Narrative: My Planner Application</strong></h3>
        
        <h4><strong>I. Brief Description of the Artifact</strong></h4>
        <p>
            The artifact I selected is the To-Do List App, an Android application developed to help users manage tasks efficiently. Originally created as part of a Mobile Architecture and Programming course, the app offers task management features such as adding, viewing, and clearing tasks, with a user-friendly design that enhances the user experience. This artifact demonstrates my ability to combine backend functionality with frontend design, emphasizing modular code architecture.
        </p>
        
        <h4><strong>II. Justification for Inclusion</strong></h4>
        <p>
            I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because it reflects my skills in algorithm design, data structures, and user interface development. By enhancing the app to include task priority and sorting algorithms, it provides a solid example of my ability to apply algorithmic principles to solve real-world problems, such as organizing tasks efficiently. The addition of these functionalities showcases my ability to handle data structures, particularly the manipulation and sorting of task data based on various attributes (like priority and due date). This artifact satisfies <strong>Category Two and Three: Algorithms - Data Structures and Database</strong>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Specific Components:</strong></li>
            <li>The task priority system demonstrates my skills in sorting algorithms.</li>
            <li>The enhanced user interface reflects my ability to design interactive and intuitive user experiences.</li>
            <li>The integration of Android SDK and Java shows proficiency in mobile app development.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>III. How the Artifact Was Improved</strong></h4>
        <p>
            Several key enhancements were made to the application, focusing on integrating a task priority system, implementing a custom sorting algorithm, and connecting the app to a database. These improvements provide a more robust and flexible task management system.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key Enhancements:</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1. Database Integration for Task Storage:</strong> I connected the application to a database, updating the task model to include fields for priority and deadline. This allows for efficient CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and supports dynamic task management.</li>
            <li><strong>2. Task Priority System:</strong> Added a priority field to each task, enabling users to assign High, Medium, or Low priority. This was implemented through modifications in the task data model.</li>
            <li><strong>3. Custom Sorting Algorithm:</strong> Developed a sorting algorithm that organizes tasks based on their assigned priority and deadline. This showcases my ability to apply algorithmic principles and ensures tasks are presented in a meaningful way.</li>
            <li><strong>4. UI Enhancements:</strong> Updated the user interface to allow users to input task priority and deadline when creating or editing tasks. The task list view was improved to reflect sorted tasks, enhancing the overall user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>IV. Meeting the Course Outcomes</strong></h4>
        <p>
            With these enhancements, I successfully aligned the artifact with the following course outcomes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Outcome 1: Collaboration and Improvement of Algorithms:</strong> The implementation of the task sorting algorithm based on priority demonstrates my ability to develop and improve algorithms, enhancing task management functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Outcome 2: Clear Presentation of Technical Concepts:</strong> The updated codebase, which includes the priority field and sorting logic, reflects my ability to clearly present complex technical concepts in both code structure and user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Outcome 3: Application of Algorithmic Principles:</strong> The new sorting algorithm based on both priority and deadlines showcases my application of algorithmic principles, improving the task management functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Outcome 4: Use of Advanced Tools and Techniques:</strong> The integration of Android SDK, Java, and database systems demonstrates my proficiency in using advanced development tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Outcome 5: Mitigation of Software Design Risks:</strong> Enhancing the database schema and improving CRUD operations mitigated risks associated with poor data management, making the application more robust.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>V. Reflection on the Process</strong></h4>
        <p>
            This enhancement process was an invaluable learning experience. Integrating the database with the updated task model and sorting logic allowed me to explore new dimensions of backend development. One major insight was understanding the relationship between data structures and user experience, ensuring that database operations are both efficient and aligned with user needs.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Database Integration:</strong> Updating the task model to support priority sorting required changes in the database structure, which presented challenges in ensuring smooth data storage and retrieval.</li>
            <li><strong>UI/UX Considerations:</strong> Modifying the user interface to support new functionality while keeping it intuitive required several iterations to balance functionality and simplicity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This enhancement process deepened my understanding of how databases, algorithms, and UI design interact to create a well-rounded, functional application. The improvements made ensure that the app is more efficient in managing tasks and offers a smoother user experience. This process solidified my ability to design and implement scalable, robust solutions in mobile development, aligning with the course outcomes related to software design, data management, and algorithmic problem-solving.
